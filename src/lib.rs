//! A library for model checking systems, with an emphasis on distributed systems.
//!
//! Most of the docs are here, but a short book is being written to provide a gentler introduction:
//! "[Building Distributed Systems With Stateright](https://www.stateright.rs)."
//!
//! # Introduction to Model Checking
//!
//! [`Model`] implementations indicate how a system evolves, such as a set of actors
//! executing a distributed protocol on an IP network. Incidentally, that scenario
//! is so common for model checking that Stateright includes an [`actor::ActorModel`],
//! and unlike many model checkers, Stateright is also able to [spawn] these
//! actors on a real network.
//!
//! Models of a system are supplemented with [`always`] and [`sometimes`] properties.
//! An `always` [`Property`] (also known as a [safety property] or [invariant]) indicates that a
//! specific problematic outcome is not possible, such as data inconsistency. A
//! `sometimes` property on the other hand is used to ensure a particular outcome
//! is reachable, such as the ability for a distributed system to process a write
//! request.
//!
//! A [`Checker`] will attempt to [discover] a counterexample
//! for every `always` property and an example for every `sometimes` property,
//! and these examples/counterexamples are indicated by sequences of system steps
//! known as [`Path`]s (also known as traces or behaviors). The presence of an
//! `always` discovery or the absence of a `sometimes` discovery indicate that
//! the model checker identified a problem with the code under test.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! A toy example that solves a [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle)
//! follows. This simple example leverages only a `sometimes` property,
//! but in most cases for a real system you would have an `always` property at
//! a minimum. The imagined use case is one in which we must ensure that a particular
//! configuration of the puzzle has a solution.
//!
//! **TIP**: see the [`actor`] module documentation for an actor system example.
//! More sophisticated examples
//! are available in the [`examples/` directory of the repository](https://github.com/stateright/stateright/tree/master/examples)
//!
//! ```rust
